# EEE3088F-Project
Power and Sensing repository for the EEE3088F Project. Group 24: RTHMAT004 and CLRMAT005

This repository contains files for both the sensing and power subsystems of a micromouse for a university project. This project involved developing a micromouse, therefore these solutions are built with existing systems in mind (microcontroller, servo motors etc). 

The power system deals with.... 

The sensing system deals with surface detection around the micromouse, inevitabely helping the micromouse navigate. The sensor does not make decisions of movement, or deal with any power control, it's only purpose is to detect objects and returning results using a voltage output signal. 

# Sensing subsystem:
The folder named "SensorKiCad-RTHMAT004" contains the KiCad files for the sensor subsystem. This subsystem solves the problem of sensing for the micromouse. This subsystem uses IR frequencies to detect objects within the bounds of the sensor. This subsystem solution should be used as a springboard for ideas surrounding sensing for devices such as a micromouse. 



make it intelligent, add description on the project, how to use our solutions. Naming conventions and difference between power and sensing. 

dont add backups, sort out .gitignore hide: backups, jlcpcb, anything thats polluting , we only want to share required files
